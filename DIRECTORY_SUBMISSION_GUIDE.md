   Hey Product Hunt! 👋

   After Unscreen shut down last month, thousands of creators lost their go-to video background removal tool. We built this free alternative using Meta's SAM2 AI to fill that gap.

   🎯 Why we built this:
   - Unscreen was $10/month and shut down without warning
   - Existing alternatives (CapCut, VEED, Kapwing) cost $10-25/month
   - Creators needed a FREE option that actually works

   ✨ What makes it different:
   - 100% free (share to remove watermark)
   - Click-to-select subjects (no manual masking)
   - Works on any video without green screen
   - Perfect for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch

   🚀 Use cases we're seeing:
   - TikTok creators making POV videos
   - Streamers creating OBS overlays
   - Product sellers making Amazon videos
   - Educators recording presentations

   Try it out and let me know what you think! Feedback welcome 🙏
   ```

4. Respond to all comments within first 4 hours
5. Share on social media asking for upvotes
6. Monitor ranking throughout the day

**Expected Result**: If done correctly, can reach #1-5 Product of the Day. This drives 1,000-5,000 visitors in first 24 hours.
