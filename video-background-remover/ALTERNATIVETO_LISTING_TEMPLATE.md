The best free Unscreen alternative after Unscreen shut down on December 1, 2025. Remove video backgrounds instantly using Meta's SAM2.1 AI - no green screen needed, no subscription required.

HOW IT WORKS:
Upload your video (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM), click points on the subject you want to keep, and our AI automatically tracks it across all frames with precision segmentation. Download your transparent background video in 1-2 minutes.

PERFECT FOR:

## 💬 FIRST COMMENT (Post After Approval)

After your listing goes live, post this as your first comment:

**Founder Comment Template:**
```
Hi everyone! Creator here 👋

I built this tool specifically to replace Unscreen after it shut down in December 2025. As someone who used Unscreen for years, I was frustrated paying $29/month for basic features.

Why I built this:
• Unscreen was expensive ($29/mo for HD + no watermark)
• Needed OBS support for streaming (Unscreen didn't have it)
• Wanted to use latest AI (SAM2.1 is way better than Unscreen's old tech)

We're currently free during testing phase (2 videos/day limit to manage server costs). Planning paid tiers eventually, but keeping generous free tier.

Happy to answer any questions! Try it out and let me know what you think.
