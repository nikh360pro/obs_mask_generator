Unscreen.com permanently shut down on December 1, 2025. I've been using this free alternative that's actually better for OBS:

https://obsmaskgenerator.com/video-background-remover/

Key features:
• 100% free (testing phase) vs Unscreen's $29/month
• 10-second videos (2x longer than Unscreen's free tier)
• OBS compatible - exports transparent MP4
• SAM2.1 AI (better than Unscreen's old tech)
• HD quality, not limited to 720p

Processed 15+ videos so far for my stream overlays. Works great with OBS as a media source.

Has anyone else tried this or other Unscreen alternatives?
